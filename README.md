# Mask_Plus Attendance System Based On SeetaFace6

With the emergence of new coronal pneumonia COVID-19, wearing masks has gradually become the norm in people's life. 
The traditional face recognition algorithm needs to provide the whole face image, but affected by the epidemic, when 
people wear masks, the traditional face recognition algorithm will not be suitable for some specific application 
scenarios. In late February 2020, the China State Council issued the guidelines for the prevention and control of 
the resumption of work and reproduction in enterprises and institutions, which was issued by the State Council in 
response to the joint prevention and control system of New Coronavirus infection. The unit should temporarily suspend 
the use of fingerprint attendance machines and register other people in other ways, thereby reducing the risk of 
infection. Therefore, in order to adapt to the current situation of normalization of epidemic prevention and control,
and facilitate the personnel statistics and monitoring in campus, station, airport and other densely populated 
transportation hubs, this paper designs and develops a "mask +" face attendance system.
  
Specifically, this paper first based on SeetaFace6 open source face recognition algorithm, using its C # language 
package version ViewFaceCore and Visual Studio 2019 platform, concurrently with the help of computer image vision 
library AForge.NET for calling the camera to read, convert and collect the face image; Then, on the basis of the 
above methods and technologies, the requirement analysis, system design, detailed design and system implementation 
of the face attendance system in the scene of wearing masks are carried out; Finally, a "mask +" face attendance 
system with good user experience is completed, which includes different scene adaptation interaction process and 
corresponding interface.

Here are some brief introduction of my work:
- Designed a Face Recognition Attendance System with mask-on under COVID-19.
- Collected and stored thousands of faces and relevant information in SQL Server.
- Deployed open-source face recognition algorithm SeetaFace6 with Aforge.NET image vision library in C#.
- Distributed the software to the college, earned 2500 credits in school ID card.
